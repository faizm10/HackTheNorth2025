Scalability in system design refers to the ability of a system to handle increased load gracefully. 
There are two main types: vertical scaling (scale-up) and horizontal scaling (scale-out). 
Vertical scaling means adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or SSD to a single machine. 
Horizontal scaling means adding more machines and distributing the workload across them.

Horizontal scaling often involves load balancers, sharding of databases, distributed caches, and eventual consistency models. 
Popular strategies include database replication, stateless services behind a load balancer, and partitioned queues.

Examples:
- Netflix handles massive traffic using auto-scaling groups in AWS, scaling out microservices during peak hours.
- Amazon uses horizontal scaling to distribute shopping cart data across multiple partitions.



Reliability ensures a system can recover from failures without loss of data or availability. 
Reliability mechanisms include replication, redundancy, and checkpointing. Systems like Google Spanner replicate data across geographic regions. 
Backups and disaster recovery are also part of reliability design.

Key Concepts:
- Replication: copying data across nodes for fault tolerance.
- Quorum protocols: ensuring writes are committed only after enough replicas acknowledge.
- Failover strategies: automatic redirection to standby systems.

Real-world:
- Banking systems rely on reliability to ensure transactional integrity.
- WhatsApp ensures reliability with message queue replication.



Availability measures the percentage of time a system is operational. 
Targets are usually expressed as Service Level Agreements (SLAs) such as 99.9% uptime (three nines). 
Techniques to ensure availability include clustering, failover, and redundant network paths.

High Availability (HA) designs often include active-active clusters, geo-replication, and health checks with auto-healing.

Example:
- Google Search maintains five-nines availability by running services across thousands of servers with failover redundancy.



Caching improves system performance by storing frequently accessed data in faster storage. 
Caches can exist at multiple layers: CDN caches, application-level caches (Redis, Memcached), and database query caches.

Strategies:
- Write-through cache: write to cache and DB simultaneously.
- Write-back cache: write to cache first, then asynchronously to DB.
- Cache-aside: read from cache first, if missing fetch from DB.

Example:
- Facebook uses Memcached clusters to reduce database load for profile and timeline queries.



Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload. 
They can operate at Layer 4 (transport level) or Layer 7 (application level).

Common algorithms:
- Round robin
- Least connections
- Weighted distribution

Advanced techniques include sticky sessions, global load balancing with DNS, and application-aware routing.

Example:
- Cloudflare and AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) offer managed solutions with health checks and automatic failover.



Databases are the backbone of system design. Choices between SQL and NoSQL impact scalability, consistency, and query patterns.

SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL):
- Strong consistency
- Structured queries
- ACID compliance

NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB):
- Flexible schemas
- High availability and partition tolerance
- Eventual consistency

CAP Theorem: a distributed database can provide at most two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

Example:
- Amazon DynamoDB powers shopping carts with eventual consistency but high availability.



Messaging queues decouple services and handle asynchronous communication. 
They improve reliability, smooth traffic spikes, and enable event-driven architectures.

Types:
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ)
- Log-based queues (Kafka)
- Cloud-native queues (AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub)

Patterns:
- Publish/subscribe
- Point-to-point
- Dead-letter queues for failed messages

Example:
- Uber uses Kafka for real-time trip and payment event streaming.



Monitoring ensures a system’s health is visible. Observability extends this to allow diagnosing complex issues.

Metrics:
- Latency
- Throughput
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

Tools:
- Prometheus for metrics scraping
- Grafana for visualization
- Jaeger for distributed tracing

Example:
- Netflix uses custom observability stacks to trace microservices across thousands of instances.



Security in system design protects confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

Core Areas:
- Authentication (OAuth, JWT, SAML)
- Authorization (RBAC, ABAC)
- Encryption (TLS, AES, RSA)
- Intrusion detection & monitoring

Best Practices:
- Principle of least privilege
- Rotating keys and secrets
- Audit logs

Example:
- Google Cloud IAM enforces fine-grained access policies for services and users.



Designing a URL shortener demonstrates multiple principles of system design.

Requirements:
- Generate unique short keys
- Map short key to original URL
- Handle high read-to-write ratio

Components:
- API servers for create/read operations
- Database or key-value store for mapping
- Cache layer for popular URLs
- Analytics module for tracking usage

Challenges:
- Avoiding collisions in hash generation
- Scaling reads with CDN caches
- Ensuring availability and fault tolerance

Example:
- Bitly and TinyURL scale globally with sharded databases and distributed caching.

- Log-based queues (Kafka)
- Cloud-native queues (AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub)

Patterns:
- Publish/subscribe
- Point-to-point
- Dead-letter queues for failed messages

Example:
- Uber uses Kafka for real-time trip and payment event streaming.



Monitoring ensures a system’s health is visible. Observability extends this to allow diagnosing complex issues.

Metrics:
- Latency
- Throughput
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

Tools:
- Prometheus for metrics scraping
- Grafana for visualization
- Jaeger for distributed tracing

Example:
- Netflix uses custom observability stacks to trace microservices across thousands of instances.



Security in system design protects confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.

Core Areas:
- Authentication (OAuth, JWT, SAML)
- Authorization (RBAC, ABAC)
- Encryption (TLS, AES, RSA)
- Intrusion detection & monitoring

Best Practices:
- Principle of least privilege
- Rotating keys and secrets
- Audit logs

Example:
- Google Cloud IAM enforces fine-grained access policies for services and users.



Designing a URL shortener demonstrates multiple principles of system design.

Requirements:
- Generate unique short keys
- Map short key to original URL
- Handle high read-to-write ratio

Components:
- API servers for create/read operations
- Database or key-value store for mapping
- Cache layer for popular URLs
- Analytics module for tracking usage

Challenges:
- Avoiding collisions in hash generation
- Scaling reads with CDN caches
- Ensuring availability and fault tolerance

Example:
- Bitly and TinyURL scale globally with sharded databases and distributed caching.

Scalability in system design refers to the ability of a system to handle increased load gracefully. 
There are two main types: vertical scaling (scale-up) and horizontal scaling (scale-out). 
Vertical scaling means adding more resources such as CPU, RAM, or SSD to a single machine. 
Horizontal scaling means adding more machines and distributing the workload across them.

Horizontal scaling often involves load balancers, sharding of databases, distributed caches, and eventual consistency models. 
Popular strategies include database replication, stateless services behind a load balancer, and partitioned queues.

Examples:
- Netflix handles massive traffic using auto-scaling groups in AWS, scaling out microservices during peak hours.
- Amazon uses horizontal scaling to distribute shopping cart data across multiple partitions.



Reliability ensures a system can recover from failures without loss of data or availability. 
Reliability mechanisms include replication, redundancy, and checkpointing. Systems like Google Spanner replicate data across geographic regions. 
Backups and disaster recovery are also part of reliability design.

Key Concepts:
- Replication: copying data across nodes for fault tolerance.
- Quorum protocols: ensuring writes are committed only after enough replicas acknowledge.
- Failover strategies: automatic redirection to standby systems.

Real-world:
- Banking systems rely on reliability to ensure transactional integrity.
- WhatsApp ensures reliability with message queue replication.



Availability measures the percentage of time a system is operational. 
Targets are usually expressed as Service Level Agreements (SLAs) such as 99.9% uptime (three nines). 
Techniques to ensure availability include clustering, failover, and redundant network paths.

High Availability (HA) designs often include active-active clusters, geo-replication, and health checks with auto-healing.

Example:
- Google Search maintains five-nines availability by running services across thousands of servers with failover redundancy.



Caching improves system performance by storing frequently accessed data in faster storage. 
Caches can exist at multiple layers: CDN caches, application-level caches (Redis, Memcached), and database query caches.

Strategies:
- Write-through cache: write to cache and DB simultaneously.
- Write-back cache: write to cache first, then asynchronously to DB.
- Cache-aside: read from cache first, if missing fetch from DB.

Example:
- Facebook uses Memcached clusters to reduce database load for profile and timeline queries.



Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload. 
They can operate at Layer 4 (transport level) or Layer 7 (application level).

Common algorithms:
- Round robin
- Least connections
- Weighted distribution

Advanced techniques include sticky sessions, global load balancing with DNS, and application-aware routing.

Example:
- Cloudflare and AWS Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) offer managed solutions with health checks and automatic failover.



Databases are the backbone of system design. Choices between SQL and NoSQL impact scalability, consistency, and query patterns.

SQL databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL):
- Strong consistency
- Structured queries
- ACID compliance

NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB):
- Flexible schemas
- High availability and partition tolerance
- Eventual consistency

CAP Theorem: a distributed database can provide at most two of Consistency, Availability, and Partition tolerance.

Example:
- Amazon DynamoDB powers shopping carts with eventual consistency but high availability.



Messaging queues decouple services and handle asynchronous communication. 
They improve reliability, smooth traffic spikes, and enable event-driven architectures.

Types:
- Message queues (RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ)
- Log-based queues (Kafka)
- Cloud-native queues (AWS SQS, Google Pub/Sub)

Patterns:
- Publish/subscribe
- Point-to-point
- Dead-letter queues for failed messages
